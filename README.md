Known Bugs:
Under unknown conditions, ingredients are not consumed when they are chopped to create the chopped version of that ingredient. I haven’t been able to replicate it so I haven’t be able to fix it.
Closing the window that shows details on an ingredient will force you to close the ingredients window as well to regain functionality of buttons.
Sometimes the customer list disappears or duplicates from previous days.

Missing features:
Ability to see what customers order before pressing the brew button
Ability to see what has been added to the pot thus far
Button color change while hovered to signal they’re available to be pressed.
